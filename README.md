This is a Flutter-based exercise tracker app using BLoC for state management and Clean Architecture
principles. The app allows users to browse a list of exercises, view details, and complete exercises
with a built-in countdown timer.

## **ðŸ§± Architecture**

The app is structured following Clean Architecture, which separates code into layers:

lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ api_data_source.dart # Handles remote API calls
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ exercise_repository_impl.dart # Implementation of repository
â”œâ”€â”€ domain/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ exercise_list_model.dart # Core entity/model
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ get_exercise_use_case.dart # Business logic/use case
â”œâ”€â”€ presentation/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ bloc/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ exercise_bloc.dart # BLoC for handling UI state/events
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ screens/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ home_screen.dart
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ detail_screen.dart
â”œâ”€â”€ core/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ utils.dart # Helper functions
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ constants.dart # Constants used in the app
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ app_theme_manager.dart # Centralized theming

## **ðŸš€ How to Run the App**

1. Clone the project
   cd exercise_app
2. Install dependencies
   flutter pub get
3. Connect a device or open an emulator
4. Run the app
   flutter run

## Known Issues / Shortcomings

* Exercise timer resets if the detail screen is popped before completion.
* Bloc state is not persisted across app restarts (no local persistence used).
* Currently supports only a basic remote data fetch; no offline capability.
* Error handling could be enhanced with more descriptive user messages.
* UI does not support landscape mode fully.
